# ZMK Configurations

## Introduction
This repository contains configuration files for building ZMK firmware and keymaps. The purpose of this repository is to provide a customizable and flexible setup for users to create their own keyboard firmware using ZMK.

## My Config
This repository contains my configuration for the Typer Active Corne 6 column keyboard. It includes custom keymaps and settings tailored to my preferences.

## Home Row Mods
The home row mods implementation in this config allows for more efficient typing by assigning modifier keys to the home row. This means that you can hold down a key on the home row to activate a modifier (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt) and tap the same key to produce a regular character. This reduces finger movement and increases typing speed and comfort.
